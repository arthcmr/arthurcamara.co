This is a statically generated website. It's actually just a landing page I built in less than two hours using Jekyll. See it in action at [my website](http://www.arthurcamara.me).

Feel free to do anything you want with the code :)

##Get Started

After cloning the projet, install dependencies:

```
gem install bundler
bundle install
bourbon install -path _assets/stylesheets
saffron install -p _assets/stylesheets
```

Build the project:

```
jekyll build
```

or serve it locally

```
jekyll serve --watch
```

Great job!
